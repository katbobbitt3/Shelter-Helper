# Shelter-Helper
Shelter Helper will be an application for animal shelters for shelter staff, volunteers, and public use. 
The application is meant to make the recording of animal data and location within the shelter for easier access to information for volunteers and the public. 

Shelter Helper will be mainly a mobile application but also be connected to a web application as well. The application will use complex GUIs, as well as secure databases to store information. The application will have three different actors with separate abilities:
The shelter staff will be able to:
-	Create shifts and schedules for volunteers to choose from
-	Create usernames and passwords for new volunteers
-	Enter in dog/cat information
o	Picture of animal
o	Breed
o	Age
o	Gender
o	Medical History
o	Behavioral notes
o	Animal ID number
o	Location within shelter (kennel number)
o	Adoption fee
o	Etc.
-	Make a dog/cat available for adoption, put a hold on a dog/cat, mark dog/cat as unavailable or foster
-	Remove a dog/cat that is adopted
-	Upload a shelter map to show animal locations
-	Enter in shelter information
o	Shelter address
o	Contact phone 
o	Shelter hours
o	Volunteer orientation dates
o	Shelter email list
Shelter volunteers will be able to:
-	Schedule themselves for volunteer shifts
-	Enter in walking times for dogs (dogs should be walked twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon)
-	Enter bathing dates for dogs (dogs bathed at least once a month)
-	View dogs that need to be walked or bathed
-	View patron requests for a volunteer
-	Mark when a cat’s kennel has been cleaned and cat has been fed
-	Etc.

The public that use the application will be able to:
-	Search through animal directory
-	View animal profiles
-	Look at animal’s location within the shelter
-	Request adoption forms for an animal
-	Make meet and greet appointments for dogs
-	Etc.
The idea behind Shelter Helper is to be a free application that has both web and mobile accessibility to make the management of a shelter easier for the staff that run the shelter and to help the animals in the shelter be better cared for.
